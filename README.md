This package is not registered. For installing the package, type

```julia
] add https://gitlab.com/greimel/Aiyagari.jl
```
in the julia REPL. See the documentation for how to solve macroeconomic models using the package.

For running the tests locally, run

```julia
] test Aiyagari
```

For now, the package can solve the Huggett model and multiple version of macroeconomic models with infinitely-lived heterogenous agents with housing.

* only homeowners (with or without adjustment costs)
* homeowners and renters with size-separated markets properties to be rented and owned
